# Linkdin Simulation
In this project, we implement a social network using the graph data structure.
In this network, each node plays the role of a person and the edges between them indicate the connection between them.
This network uses the Heap data structure to suggest similar people to the user, which is done through an algorithm (DFS algorithm) to score and sort the people with the highest score (the most similar) and show them to the user.
